This mod removes the projectiles from Pull, Throw, Warp and Singularity.
Paired with the [Individual Cooldowns Mod](
https://www.nexusmods.com/masseffect3/mods/456) this results into a
gameplay experience very similar to Mass Effect 1.

## Installation
The easiest and recommended way to install this mod is by using the
[ME3Tweaks Mod Manager](https://me3tweaks.com/modmanager).

If you want to install the mod manually make sure that you have installed
[ErikJS's Binkw32 Proxy DLL](https://github.com/Erik-JS/masseffect-binkw32),
as this enables the game to load unsigned DLCs. After that simply extract the
7z and copy the `DLC_MOD_CBIOTIC` directory into your `%ME3PATH%\BIOGame\DLC`
directory. (Replace `%ME3PATH%` with your ME3 installation path, usually
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\Mass Effect 3`)

## Uninstallation
If you are not happy with the mod or simply want to remove it because of other
reasons, uninstallation is very easy. Either use your mod manager or remove
the `DLC_MOD_CBIOTIC` directory from ME3's DLC directory.

## Issues
Sometimes powers miss although the game highlights a target, this is due the
removal of projectile arching. The solution to this is to simply aim directly
at the target.
